def my_atoi(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

    The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

    Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
    Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity
    if neither present.
    Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the
    end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
    Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round
    the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231,
    and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.

    Return the integer as the final result.
